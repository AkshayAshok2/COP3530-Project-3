# Lightweight Optimal Integrated Search (LOIS)
This repository houses files used for the final project in the class COP3530 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms at UF. LOIS is essentially a small search engine for the American sitcom Family Guy. Search is enabled by two string-matching algorithms: BP-DP and filter search. Key words/phrases are input and processed in these algorithms, which then find the closest matches in the set of all Family Guy episodes. The set of requested characters in the input also bounds the output episodes. Altogether, the program allows the user to choose which characters they want on screen as well as find an episode that includes the provided input in its script.
